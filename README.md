using [json_api_client](https://github.com/chingor13/json_api_client) and [jsonapi-resources](https://github.com/cerebris/jsonapi-resources)

* create db
* fill some data in contacts and phone_numbers
* run "rails s" and "rails c" on different consoles
* use Client::Contact or Client::PhoneNumber to fetch or fill data

you will see client result on console and pretty printed response in server log
